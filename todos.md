Here is a brief list of "TODOs". More are available also in the code itself. When using vscode it is possible to use the "todo tree" extension to have a full list.

* fix the queue page:
  * better visualization/layout
  * playlist element that shows at which point of the playlist we are
  * change the buttons in:
    * clear queue
    * next drawing
    * stop all
    * pause/resume
* highlight which drawing is being used both in the full list and in the playlist
* add the possibility to save the interval between drawings in the playlists
* save the interval between drawings in the home/drawings pages such that is loaded instead of being reset every time
* add back a button to queue multiple playlists (also with the interval option)
* add the possibility to select playlists instead of drawings in the autostart settings
* add the possibility to start/stop/pause with hw buttons (something like: in the settings page possibility to add pins and let select what the pin does from a select list)
* add leds control (with color selection and animations)
* add an leds control element for the playlists
* create some automatic tests (both python and js) to validate the software before merging
* make a better preview for the full drawing (preview with respect to the table used)
