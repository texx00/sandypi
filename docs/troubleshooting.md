# Installation troubleshooting

This list is quite short since with the new Docker installation there should be fewer problems.
Please open an issue if you encounter difficulties during the installation.

## After the update the browser is stuck on a gray/white page

When updating from one version to another, for the moment, it may happen that the software get stuck on old data.

To fix the problem: 
 * clear the cache of the browser 

or
 * in the browser console (google -> how to open "browser name" javascript console) run the command `localStorage.clear()`

Then reload the page

## Still no solution?

If the previous suggestions didn't help you open an issue.
Please specify:
* operating system
* server device (PC, Raspberry version, ...)
* firmware (Marlin, Grbl, ...)
* The issue
* add a copy of the terminal result you get during the installation and when after running the software in orded to analyze better the problem
* if the UI is working, you can download a diagnostic zip file that can be uploaded together with the issue. This can be done with the button located at the bottom of the settings page.
